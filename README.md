#### Home Page
The home page displays all habits for a user with options to sort them. Users can add habits and categories from the home page. This is the primary page where users can click and hold on habits to update the daily progress. Once the daily progress is complete, the streak will be updated on the Habit Page.

#### Category Page
The category page displays all habits for a user within a category and has options to sort them like the home page. Users can add habits directly to a category form this page. This page also has functionality to update the daily progress of habits like the home page.

#### Habit Page
The habit page shows stats about a particular habit. At the top it shows the best check-in streak, number of day completions, and percentage to complete (if goal days is set). Right above the graphs it shows the timeframe remaining for the habit (if goal days is set). It shows a streak graph, a time density graph for the most frequent check-in times, and a bar graph showing the most common days of the week the habit is completed. Also from the page a habit can be edited, or in the case the habit check-in streak has reached its goal days users can choose how to continue with their habit.

#### User Stats Page
The user stats page is similar to the habit page stats just applied to all habits. The first line graph differs by showing how many total habits were completed for the day in the past week. The other graphs are simply applied to all habits.
